A very simple /np plugin for hexchat using rhythmbox.
I couldn't find one online, so I just wrote one.

Symlinc or just drop plugin.py inside ~/.config/hexchat/addons and it'll load
on startup automatically.

Released into the public domain.

Usage:

/np -> display current playing song

/np_set_massge <message> -> set or unsets the message

/np_set_format <format> -> set or unsets the format used when getting information from rhythmbox
